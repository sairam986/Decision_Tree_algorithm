# Decision_Tree_algorithm
Prediction of Iris.csv dataset for decision tree algorithm using supervise learning machine algorithm


**Project Statement**


 A American based botnical garden grow Iris flowers in their Labs but using biotechnology in single tree different type of variety flowers is grow. As a datascience engineer find out how accuracy is there all categories contains same species.

**Conclusion** 

According to the conclusion the all the species not contains same.But only some cases it is 1% of species
